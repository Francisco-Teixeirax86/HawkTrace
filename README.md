# HawkTrace - Distributed SIEM System

A scalable, distributed Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system built with modern technologies and microservices architecture.

## üöÄ Project Overview

HawkTrace is a comprehensive SIEM solution designed to collect, parse, analyze, and visualize security logs from various sources. Built with a pluggable architecture, it can handle multiple log formats and scale horizontally.

The objective of this project is to have a centralized project for me to try new technologies by building pluggable services into the main project.


### Key Features

- **Multi-format Log Collection**: Supports JSON, Apache, Nginx, Syslog, and custom formats
- **Real-time Processing**: Streaming log analysis with Kafka
- **Intelligent Parsing**: Pluggable parser architecture with automatic format detection
- **Advanced Search**: Elasticsearch-powered log storage and search
- **Threat Detection**: Rule-based and ML-powered security analysis
- **Modern UI**: React-based dashboard with real-time updates
- **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes-ready with Docker support

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

As the project is still evolving, and I am still learning, the architecture is not final as I am still not satisfied
with the projects current state.
